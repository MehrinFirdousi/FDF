# FDF
Wireframe modeling using Minilibx

# About the project
This project is to model 3D landscapes and structures as wireframes using isometric projection, the model can be translated and rotated to view it from different angles. 

# Features
* View a model in 2D (top-view)
* 3D view using isometric projection
* 3D view using cabinet projection
* Translation
* Zoom in/out 
* Rotation of model along x, y and z axes
* Make model bounce off windows edges (like the old DVD screensaver)
